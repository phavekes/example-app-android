# Verifai SDK Android example app
This repository contains two example implementations (Kotlin and Java) of the Verifai Android SDK. The Verifai SDK can be used to verify the identity of users. This can be done by scanning passports or other identification documents with the camera of the Android device. 

Not sure what it does yet? Download our demo from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.verifai.demo).

The latest documentation that describes the use of this SDK can be found over here: [https://docs.verifai.com/android_docs/android-sdk-latest.html](https://verifai.dev/mobile-sdk/android-sdk-latest.html#quick-start). Please feel free to submit issues, pull requests and/or [contact our support](https://www.verifai.com/en/support/).
