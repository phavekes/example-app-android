# Verifai SDK Android example app

This repository contains two example implementations (written in Kotlin and
Java) of the Verifai Android SDK. The Verifai SDK can be used to verify the
identity of users. This can be done by scanning passports or other
identification documents with the camera of the Android device. This in
combination with on device optical character recognition (OCR).

The latest documentation that describes the use of this SDK can be found over
here: [docs](https://docs.verifai.com/sdk/android/). Please feel free to submit
issues, pull requests and/or
[contact our support](https://www.verifai.com/en/support/).

A Verifai licence is needed to make the examples work. Request a licence at
[https://dashboard.verifai.com](https://dashboard.verifai.com). To convert the
licence string to the right format in gradle.properties, the
`create_licence_string.sh` can be used.

```bash
.\create_licence_string "my licence string from the dashboard"
```
